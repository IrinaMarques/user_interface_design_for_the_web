2.1 What is User Interface Design?
====================================

Represents the means which can communicate with a virtual identinty.

Visual hierarchy: 
- how the page is structured 
- which elements are first to be noticed
- visually appealing structure 
- the page make sense
- how information is structured in the page
- make the page easy to navigate

We only foucus on UI Design for the web but the principles apply to the larger concept of UI.

======================
2.2 Know the End Goal
======================

What is the purpose of the website?
- backend platform?
- content management?
In each case every UI needs to be diferent.

Some examples:

mailchimp.com
- Clear menssage
- Instructions how to continue
- Make an action - Sign for free
Main goal --> make the user to sign up
- Once you log in it changes the layout
- Preserve the minimalistic design
- The top menu (to make an action) move to the left side
Main goal --> help to create, send and track email newletters

The UI can change it's form depending on what is end goal is. What you want to do with that UI.

google.com
- search engine based on a search box
- don't need anything else

Depending on what that webside needs to do it can have very diferent form.
