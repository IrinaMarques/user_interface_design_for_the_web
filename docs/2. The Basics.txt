====================================
2.1 What is User Interface Design?
====================================

Represents the means which can communicate with a virtual identinty.

Visual hierarchy: 
- how the page is structured 
- which elements are first to be noticed
- visually appealing structure 
- the page make sense
- how information is structured in the page
- make the page easy to navigate

We only foucus on UI Design for the web but the principles apply to the larger concept of UI.

======================
2.2 Know the End Goal
======================

What is the purpose of the website?
- backend platform?
- content management?
In each case every UI needs to be diferent.

Some examples:

mailchimp.com
- Clear menssage
- Instructions how to continue
- Make an action - Sign for free
Main goal --> make the user to sign up
- Once you log in it changes the layout
- Preserve the minimalistic design
- The top menu (to make an action) move to the left side
Main goal --> help to create, send and track email newletters

The UI can change it's form depending on what is end goal is. What you want to do with that UI.

google.com
- search engine based on a search box
- don't need anything else

Depending on what that webside needs to do it can have very diferent form.

==========================
2.3 Get to know your user
==========================

"Obsessed over customers"
Make sure the user can use the interface that you are building effectively and with litle efford.
Create an interface that allows them to achieve their goals.

Best way is to meet with them.

Get feedback on an existing product.

=============================
2.4 Don't Reinvent the Wheel
=============================

Patterns is something we should use.
- Use patterns and workflows that your customers are used to (search boxes, menus, buttons...)
- Use some well known layouts (menu on the top, sidebar on the side)

The sidebar can be collapsed.

Use the items that already exists and make them look differently.

=========================
2.5 Use Visual Hierarchy
=========================

Visual Hierarchy:
- to organize the website
- make the page readble 

1. Header:
First thing the user see.
Preference for headings like h1
The header will iclude:
- The logo: on the left side
- The form: in the right site

2. Navigation
Clearly positioned on the top of the page
With a list

3. Section: Page title
Big and visible to users

4. A smaller button
Give a style to some that we can see. So people will know that is a button.

5. Sub section: 
Use headings from h2/h3 
Big title that can be seen
Can use a separator <hr>

6. Section:
Follow the same principle as the first section

7. The sidebar:
Put on the right side

UI shows: 
Each elements are more important,
What they should do,
Clear understand of the webpage

====================
2.6 Stay Consistent
====================

Important:
Users need to know that they are in control of the system they are using.
They elements should be group with the same type of elements.

Advice:
Use common elements
Same themes
make them consistent
Use things that can repeat

============================
2.7 Always Provide Feedback
============================

User interface should be able to conect with the user
- If users actions are correct they are encourage. 
- If they are doing something wrong they should know about.

Theach the user how it should be used.
- When you fill out a form, know that we are doing it right.
- When we make a mistake we get a message that describes that error in detail and tell how to fix it.

The messages are accomplished by colors that allow user to identify what is right and wrong.
Focous with additional explanation

Important the notifications --> give feedback.
Way to comunicate with the user

=================================
2.8 Keep it Simple and Intuitive
=================================
